  The world around us is changing. Long-term trends, driven by public policy 
  and the exponential rate of change in the digital infrastructure, are 
  fundamentally altering the global business environment. We initially respond 
  to these changes by working harder within existing institutions and practices. 
  The result is diminishing performance and mounting stress. Until we 
  understand the nature of those changes and evolve our institutions and practices 
  accordingly, we won't be able to effectively harness new capabilities and turn stress into success.

  <p class="lead">
   What questions should we be asking about the features and functionality of future 
   library systems? Today we will explore three ongoing themes that impact libraries
   and their patrons. Each theme prompts us to ask different 
   questions about what we should expect from our future library systems.

   <h1>Our Future tracks the book</h1>
  </a>
  <p class="lead">While libraries pre-date the book, for the past few
    centuries as the central repository of monographs for our communities
    dominated our identity. Just in the past ten years has the book started to
    shifting to new, more online forms that split the content from the print
    format.

   <h1>Discovery happens elsewhere&hellip;</h1>
  </a> 
  <p class="lead">
   While it shouldn't be too controversial to state that many of our potential 
   library patrons will find our collections through these sources beside our
   catalogs and discovery services:

  <ul class="lead">
    <li>Commercial search engines
     like <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and 
     <a href="http://bing.com/">Microsoft Bing</a>
	</li>
	<li>Popular social networks like <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, 
     <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, or 
     <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
	<li>
	 Or increasingly through apps running on mobile phones, tablets, and other devices.

 <p class="lead">
  The library is becoming the center of creative activity in our
  communities through the library's emerging roles as an open access
  journal publisher, digital archivist through institutional 
  repositories, and as experimental manufacturers using 3-D printers in 
  library MakerLabs.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
 <a href="{{ url_for('slide', slide='one-approach-to-lib-sys') }}">
  <h1>One Approach to Future Library Systems</h1>
 </a>
 <p class="lead">
  Inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">Lean Startup</a> and 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">Lean Manufacturing</a> concepts;
  the <a href="http://intro2libys.info/catalog-pull-platform">Catalog Pull Platform</a> is
  taking an alternative approach to library technology and systems. Instead of trying to 
  anticipate demand through "pushing" services and technology to our patrons and staff, the 
  Catalog Pull Platform identifys and responding to needs and demands for library technology by 
  "pulling" directly from various constituencies in our libraries.
