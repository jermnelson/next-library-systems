  The world around us is changing. Long-term trends, driven by public policy 
  and the exponential rate of change in the digital infrastructure, are 
  fundamentally altering the global business environment. We initially respond

  The result is diminishing performance and mounting stress. Until we 
  understand the nature of those changes and evolve our institutions and practices 
  accordingly, we won't be able to effectively harness new capabilities and turn stress into success.
